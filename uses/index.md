A rundown of my setup and the current apps that I use in 2025. ([2024 version](/uses/2024/)).

## Changes

Every year I use Adobe less and less and less.

## Hardware

My main work machine is a 2020 Mac Mini with an M1 chip which I use with a 5K LG display. I have a 2022 15" M2 MacBook Air I can use away from the desk. The Mini's M1 chip is still going strong and the Air is plenty quick enough and both run silent. I use [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) and a dotfiles repo to keep my dev setup in sync between the two machines.

My main phone is a Pixel (a 5 at time of writing). I have some wireless AKG N Series headphones for work (very comfortable, but can fall off I'm agreeing _too_ enthusiastically on a call), and Sennheiser CX300s for out and about.

## Editor

I use VS Code with Copilot completions (not a big user of chat... yet). The ability to customise it is extremely valuable to me because I work across a range of languages, and I got huge value from Caleb Porzio's [Make VS Code Awesome](https://makevscodeawesome.com/) package. That gives me a really elegant setup with very few changes required. Sadly, my VS Code setup is not quite as pretty since [an update broke Monkey Patch and Customize UI](https://github.com/iocave/monkey-patch/issues/51) 😢.

I use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with custom ligatures set.

## Terminal

I tend to use VS Code's integrated terminal most often, but for tasks not related to a specific project I use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with the Z Shell and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the [Sorin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#sorin) theme. I use Fira Code here too.

## Git

Most of my project's code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and I use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app for most tasks as it's still much quicker and less error-prone for me to switch between projects and make commits with a visual GUI than on the command line.

## Web

I register domains with GoDaddy as they still seem to cover the most TLDs and I like the ability to access a client's domains via my own account. The UI is a bit slow, but I haven't had a serious issue with them yet. I tend to update the nameservers to use Cloudflare as I prefer to manage DNS records there.

For managed hosting I recommend [34SP](https://www.34sp.com/), but I tend to host on Digital Ocean with servers managed by [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/). That provides me with a nice balance between being able to customise servers without having to leave my comfort zone.

For static sites I go with Cloudflare Pages, but I still have a few on Netlify (including this site).
