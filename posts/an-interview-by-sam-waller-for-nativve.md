## Building the information super-highway

> The internet… it’s pretty big these days, isn’t it? The so-called information superhighway has gone from being a quiet country lane to a fully-fledged six-lane autobahn, and is showing no signs of slowing down.
>
> But this rapid development didn’t just happen on its own—behind all those fancy websites there’s a slew of hard-working web designers, building the brave new world one line of code at a time. Mike Fallows is one of them.
>
> We met up with him in the physical world to discuss the place they call cyberspace.
