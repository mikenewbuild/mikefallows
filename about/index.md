I'm Mike. I _really_ like websites and I still think the internet is kinda magic.

As a designer and web developer with over 20 years of experience, I have a reputation for creating intelligent, contemporary and approachable work for the lifestyle industry.

I founded a collaborative design practise, A to M, which ran for 13 years and worked with industry-leading clients such as Levi's premium labels (RED, Vintage Clothing, Made & Crafted) influential retailer, Oi Polloi and pioneering cultural events like the London Short Film Festival and Queer Up North. In 2017 I set up [Newbuild Studio](https://newbuild.studio/) to focus primarily on technical consulting for direct-to-consumer brands.

Variously living in Bromsgrove, Brunei & Berlin – and less alliteratively: Preston, Swindon (_up the Robins_) & Manchester – I now reside in a sleepy commuter village near Stockport.
