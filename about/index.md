I'm Mike. I _really_ like websites and I still think the internet is kinda magic.

As a designer and web developer with 20 years of experience, I have a reputation for creating intelligent, contemporary and approachable work for the lifestyle industry.

I founded a collaborative design practice, A to M, which ran for 13 years and worked with industry-leading clients such as Levi's premium labels (RED, Vintage Clothing, Made & Crafted) and influential retailer, Oi Polloi. In 2017 I set up [Newbuild Studio](https://newbuild.studio/) to focus on technical consulting for direct-to-consumer brands including Stan Ray, Millican and Manastash.

Variously living in Bromsgrove, Brunei and Berlin – I now reside in a sleepy village just outside the post-industrial city of Manchester.

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrmikefallows).
